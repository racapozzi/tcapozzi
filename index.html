      <P>
        My name is Tony Capozzi. I am a college graduate, I'm a United States Navy veteran,
        I'm computer technician at Northwest Shoals Community College. I have both an Associates and Bachelor's degree focusing
        in computer information systems. I obtained my Associates degree in 2013, and finished my Bachelor's of Business Administration
        from the University of North Alabama in 2015. I have a long standing passion for all things tech related and more specifically
        personal computers. I built my first computer shortly after graduating from high school in the year 2000 and have sought a career
        involving this passion every since that day.
