        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <P>
          My name is Tony Capozzi. I am a college graduate, I'm a United States Navy veteran,
          I'm computer technician at Northwest Shoals Community College. I graduated from NWSCC in 2013 with my Associates
          in Science majoring in computer information systems. I went on to graduate from the University of North Alabama
          in 2015 with my Bachelor's in Business Administration majoring in computer information systems. I have tinkered with PC's
          since the year 2000 when I built my first personal computer, since that day I have had a passion for computers and most
          things tech related.
